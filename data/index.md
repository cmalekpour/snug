# Hey.

This is my blog. I've been meaning to start a blog for a while, and several people have been pushing me to start writing. As someone who never posts on the internet in any form, it was a bit of a jump, but I figured it was worth pursuing.

I guess I probably wouldn't be a "real developer" if I didn't mention what this blog is running. I wanted to develop simple blog software that I could run on GitHub pages. Each post is rendered from a Markdown file ([here's this one](data/index.md)), with a little bit of typesetting and CSS added on top. I use it for my notes as well.

I'm a big fan of minimalism in web design. My home page started as a complex page and has since been stripped down to the bare essentials of HTML and CSS. In that same vein, I've tried to make the blog as simple and optimized for reading as possible. Hopefully you find it of some interest.
